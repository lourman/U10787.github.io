      <p>The aim(s) of the module is to develop your capability to develop simple C# solutions to problem based situations. This will cover more complex programming concepts than looked at in Introduction to C# as well as concepts of Graphical User Interface development and design and linking C# systems to filestore. The module will also give students the opportunity to practice skills initially learned in the pre-requisite module to develop mastery. </p>
      <p><strong>Learning Outcomes:&nbsp;      </strong></p>
<ol style="text-align: left">
		<li style="color: #FFFFFF; text-align: left;">Use a data and process driven mechanism to design and create simple solutions to problem situations using Graphical User Interface based solutions;</li>
			<li style="color: #FFFFFF; text-align: left;">Have an understanding and utilise effectively simple guideline approaches to good GUI design;</li>
			<li style="color: #FFFFFF; text-align: left;">Use simple programming constructs effectively, show a development in using more complex constructs and use objects from existing classes.</li>

      <p class="tag">SRS, Git, SVN, GitHub</p>
      <p class="text_column">Before creating an application, there are several steps that should be followed to ensure that there is a clear understanding of the problem trying to solve and the requirements for the application. Such steps can be defining the problem and its scope, create and review requirements. Following these steps will help you to create a clear plan for the development of the application, and will ensure that you have a solid understanding of the requirements and constraints for the project.</p>

      <p class="tag">Classes, Constructors, Properties, Methods&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
      <p class="text_column">In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a template for creating objects. It specifies the variables and methods that objects of that class will have. Classes are typically organized in a hierarchy, with a top-level class (also called a "base class") and subclasses that inherit characteristics from the base class and can also have their own unique characteristics.

Objects are instances of a class and are created by calling the class's constructor method. Each object has its own set of variables and methods, which are defined by the class. Objects can also interact with each other through methods, allowing them to send and receive messages to each other and collaborate to perform tasks.

OOP allows developers to create modular, reusable code, and to think about the design and organization of their code in terms of the objects and their relationships to each other. It is a fundamental concept in many programming languages, including Python, Java, C++, and C#.</p>

      <h4>Algorithm Development</h4>
      <p class="tag">Sorting, Searching</p>
      <p class="text_column">Sorting algorithms are algorithms that rearrange a given set of elements in a certain order. Common sorting algorithms include insertion sort, selection sort, bubble sort, merge sort, and quick sort. Searching algorithms are algorithms that search for a specific item in a given set of elements.Common searching algorithms include linear search, binary search, fibonacci search and jump search.</p>

    <div class="thumbnail"> <a href="#"><img src="images/funtion.png" alt="" width="2000" class="cards"/></a>
      <h4>Methods</h4>
      <p class="tag">By Value, By Ref, Params</p>
      <p class="text_column">Allocation by value is when a variable is assigned a value directly, such as when a number is assigned to an integer variable. Allocation by reference is when a variable is assigned a reference to an object, such as when an object is assigned to a variable. In this case, the variable is not actually storing the object, but rather a reference to the object.</p>

      <h4>Errors and Exceptions</h4>
      <p class="tag">Try, Catch, Exception</p>
      <p class="text_column">An error is a problem that occurs when a program is unable to execute a certain task. An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. Exceptions are usually caused by errors, but can also be caused by user input or other external factors.</p>

      <h4>Memory and Collections</h4>
      <p class="tag">Heap, Stack, Array, List</p>
      <p class="text_column">Heap and stack are two different types of memory allocation. The heap is a region of memory used for dynamic memory allocation, while the stack is used for static memory allocation. The heap is less organized than the stack and allows for more flexibility in memory allocation, while the stack is more organized and efficient.</p>

    <div class="thumbnail"> <a href="#"><img src="images/Query.png" alt="" width="2000" class="cards"/></a>
      <h4>Introduction to LINQ</h4>
      <p class="tag">LINQ, Data Sets</p>
      <p class="text_column">LINQ (Language Integrated Query) is a Microsoft .NET Framework component that adds native data querying capabilities to C# and Visual Basic. LINQ extends the language by the addition of query expressions, which are akin to SQL statements, and can be used to conveniently extract and process data from arrays, enumerable classes, XML documents, relational databases, and third-party data sources.</p>

      <h4>File Systems</h4>
      <p class="tag">Files, Text, Binary</p>
      <p class="text_column">A file system is a set of rules and methods used to organize and store data on a computer. It is responsible for keeping track of all the files and directories, and the information associated with them, such as their location, size, and permissions. It also provides access to the data stored in the files and directories. File systems are used to store and organize data on a computer, and they are essential for the proper functioning of the computer.</p>
