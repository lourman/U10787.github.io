		  <h3>1. Setting Up Git</h3>
		  <p> 
			  For us to learn Git we shall use the Git Bash, an application for Microsoft Windows environments which provides an emulation layer for a Git command line experience. Bash is an acronym for Bourne Again Shell. A shell is a terminal application used to interface with an operating system through written commands. Select <strong>Start</strong> button and scroll or type to find the app <strong>Git Bash</strong>

			 To use Git on your account or a new computer, we first need to set some basic configurations. These include things such as our name and email address, our preferred text editor, and that we want these settings to apply globally to all projects. We can use Git commands on the command line by typing "git verb options", where "verb" is the action we want to perform and "options" are any additional optional details needed for the action. For example, when setting up a new laptop, I would use Git commands to configure these settings in the following manner:
		</p>
		<pre>
		<code>
			$ git config --global user.name "Alexios Louridas"
			$ git config --global user.email "alexios.louridas@canterbury.ac.uk"
		</code>
		</pre>
		<h4>Task 1.1</h4>
		<p>Configure your git account using your <strong>own name and email address instead of mine</strong>. This user name and email will be associated with your subsequent Git activity, which means that any changes pushed to GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab or another Git host server after this task will include this information.</p>

		<p>
			The user name and email you configure will be linked to all your future Git actions. This means that any changes you push to a Git host server, such as GitHub will include this information. It's important to use the same email address for this configuration as the one you used to set up your GitHub account (your university login). If you are concerned about privacy, you can follow GitHub's instructions for keeping your email address private.
		</p>

		<p>
			All source file changes reside on what we call a “branch.”. The main branch in a Git repo is called "main" and is the repository of all the code and other files that are pushed to the repository by users. It is the main branch of the version control system, and it contains the most recent version of the code. All the other branches are based on this main branch and their changes can be merged into the main branch.
		</p>
			
		<p>
			Prior to 2020 the "main" branch was called "master", but the term is regarded to be racist and linked to human slavery. Thus, the software development community has moved to adopt a more inclusive language. In 2020, many popular Git code hosting services, such as GitHub and GitLab, began naming their default branch main rather than the traditional master. Though Git has not yet adopted this change, local repositories can easily be configured to use "main" as their default branch, allowing them to match the same name as most cloud services.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Task 1.2</h4>
		<p>
			To change the name of the main branch you would need to update the "init.defaultBranch" value defaults from "master" to "main". using the git command "git config" change globally the defaule main branch to "main".  		
			
		</p>
			You should have noticed that all commands that you have ran above only need to be run once and the flag "--global" tells Git to use the settings for every project, in your user account, on this computer.
			You can check your settings at any time by running the command:		
		</p>
	  	<pre>
		<code>
			$ git config --list			
		</code>
		</pre>
	  
	  	<h4>Optional Task</h4>
	  	<p> The first time we introduced git in the university we had to setup a proxy, although we are no longer in need of these. We have seen that in some accounts the proxies are setup. Check you settings as mentioned above and verify that no proxy has been set. If a proxy has been set unset it using the following commands (if there are capitals please use capitals):</p>
	  	<pre>
		<code>
			$ git config --global --unset http.proxy
			$ git config --global --unset https.proxy		
		</code>
		</pre>
	  
	  	<p>In case that you are setting up git at your home computer and you need to go through a proxy then to set the proxy you would need to use the following commands:</p>
	  	<pre>
		<code>
			$ git config --global http.proxy proxy-url
			$ git config --global https.proxy proxy-url		
		</code>
		</pre>
	  	<h3>2. Creating a Git Repository</h3>
	    <p>Now that you have configured git on your computer you can proceed to create your first Git repository. To do that you would need first to navigate to the computer folder you wish to use for storing your git repository. Let us assume we need to go and create a git repository in a new folder in the desktop. So we shall first need to navigate to the desktop, then create the directory and eventually go within that directory:</p>
	  
	  <pre>
		<code>
			$ cd ~/Desktop
			$ mkdir firstRepo
			$ cd firstRepo		
		</code>
		</pre>
	  <p> We shall now make Git create our first repository:</p>
	  <pre>
		<code>
			$ git init	
		</code>
		</pre>
	  <p>It is crucial to understand that executing <strong><em>git init</em></strong> will establish a repository that can contain subfolders and their associated files - there is no requirement to establish multiple repositories within the <strong><em>firstRepo</em></strong> repository, whether subdirectories are initially present or added later. Additionally, it is important to keep in mind that the creation of the <strong><em>firstRepo</em></strong> directory and its initialization as a repository are two distinct steps.</p>
	  <p>If we use the <strong><em>ls</em></strong> command to display the contents of the directory, it may appear that no changes have occurred. But if we use the <strong><em>-a</em></strong> flag then we shall see that a hidden directory has been created.</p>
	  <pre>
		<code>
			PC MINGW64 ~/Desktop/firstRepo (master)
			$ ls

			PC MINGW64 ~/Desktop/firstRepo (master)
			$ ls -a
			./  ../  .git/	
		</code>
		</pre>
	  <p>Git employs the use of this unique subfolder to keep track of all information related to the project, comprising of the files and subdirectories inside the project's directory. It's worth noting that if we delete the <strong><em>.git</em></strong> subfolder, we'll lose the project's history and we no longer have a repository.</p>
	  <p>Following that, we'll alter the default branch to be referred to as <strong><em>main</em></strong>. This may already be the default branch, depending on your git settings and version. We should also try and see the status of repository after the change:</p>
	  <pre>
	  	<code>
			PC MINGW64 ~/Desktop/firstRepo (master)
			$ git checkout -b main
			Switched to a new branch 'main'

			PC MINGW64 ~/Desktop/firstRepo (main)
			$ git status
			On branch main

			No commits yet nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
		</code>
		</pre>
	  <h4>Task 2.1</h4>
	  <p>Close Git Bash and reopen it. Now navigate back to your first repository and create a subfolder within your git repository called secondRepo. Go within that subfolder and initialise a new repository.</p>
	  <button onclick="myFunction()">Solution</button>

	  <div id="myDIV">
	  	<pre>
	  	<code>
			$ cd ~/Desktop        # return to Desktop directory
			$ cd firstRepo        # go into firstRepo directory, which is already a Git repository
			$ ls -a               # ensure the .git subdirectory is still present in the firstRepo directory
			$ mkdir secondRepo    # make a subdirectory firstRepo/secondRepo
			$ cd secondRepo       # go into secondRepo subdirectory
			$ git init            # make the secondRepo subdirectory a Git repository
			$ ls -a               # ensure the .git subdirectory is present indicating we have created a new Git repository
		</code>
		</pre>
      </div>

	  

	 <script>
		function myFunction() {
  		var x = document.getElementById("myDIV");
  		if (x.style.display === "none") {
    	x.style.display = "block";
  		} else {
    	x.style.display = "none";
  		}
		}
	  </script>
	  
	  <p> Although you successfully created a second repository within another repository this can lead to confusion. We need to remove the nested repository, to do this we shall need to undo the <strong><em>git init</em></strong> command within your <strong><em>secondRepo</em></strong> subfolder.</p>
	  <p> To do this we can just delete the files or subdirectory we created. Although, that might be very easy to do you need to be careful cause if you delete a file or folder that is not being tracked by <strong><em>git</em></strong>, then you shall not be able to recover it using git.</p>
	  <p> To remove files you can use the bash command <strong><em>rm</em></strong> followed by the filename. Similarly you can use the <strong><em>rm</em></strong> command to remove directories using the <strong><em>rm -r Directory_Name</em></strong> or <strong><em>rm -rf Directory_Name</em></strong></p>
	  <h4>Task 2.2</h4>
	  <p>Remove the <strong><em>secondRepo</em></strong> directory.</p>
