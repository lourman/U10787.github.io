		  <h3>1. Setting Up Git</h3>
		  <p>
			 To use Git on your account or a new computer, we first need to set some basic configurations. These include things such as our name and email address, our preferred text editor, and that we want these settings to apply globally to all projects. We can use Git commands on the command line by typing "git verb options", where "verb" is the action we want to perform and "options" are any additional optional details needed for the action. For example, when setting up a new laptop, I would use Git commands to configure these settings in the following manner:
		</p>
		<pre>
		<code>
			$ git config --global user.name "Alexios Louridas"
			$ git config --global user.email "alexios.louridas@canterbury.ac.uk"
		</code>
		</pre>
		<h4>Task 1.1</h4>
		<p>Configure your git account using your own name and email address instead of mine. This user name and email will be associated with your subsequent Git activity, which means that any changes pushed to GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab or another Git host server after this lesson will include this information.


		The user name and email you configure will be linked to all your future Git actions. This means that any changes you push to a Git host server, such as GitHub, BitBucket, or GitLab, will include this information. It's important to use the same email address for this configuration as the one you used to set up your GitHub account. If you are concerned about privacy, you can follow GitHub's instructions for keeping your email address private.
